Step 0: Setup Project

Create folder structure as previously finalized:

index.html (homepage)

/auth/, /products/, /cart/, /checkout/, /dashboard/, /admin/, /misc/, /policy/, /newsletter/

/assets/css/custom.css, /assets/js/main.js, /assets/images/

/components/header.html, /components/footer.html, /components/modals.html

/preloader/loader.html

Include Tailwind via CDN in all HTML pages

Link custom.css and main.js in all pages

Step 1: Preloader

Design preloader HTML (preloader/loader.html) using logo + spinner/pulse

Add animation using Tailwind + minimal custom CSS

In main.js, implement preloader logic:

Wait until all images and assets are loaded

Smoothly fade out preloader

Test on homepage first to ensure first-time visitors only see fully loaded page

Step 2: Header & Footer Components

Create reusable header with:

Logo (text-based)

Navigation links: Home, Products, About, Contact

Cart icon with item count

User account/login button

Icon slide-out animations with text

Create footer component:

Contact info

Social links

Newsletter form

Include these in all pages as partials (or copy for each HTML page in static setup)

Step 3: Homepage

Hero section → large featured image, tagline, CTA

Category showcase → Men, Women, Accessories

Featured products carousel → pull live data from backend

Add real-time product updates (sse)

Step 4: Authentication Pages

User login (/auth/login) & registration (/auth/register)

Integrate Firebase Google login for registration/login

Local storage to persist session

Admin login (/auth/admin)

Store admin session separately in local storage

Ensure real-time login state reflected across pages

Step 5: Product Pages

Product gallery (/products/index.html)

Grid layout, responsive

Filters (category, size)

Pull live products from Flask backend

Product detail (/products/product/index.html)

Images, description, size options, quantity selector

Add-to-cart → update local storage & cart icon instantly

Implement real-time updates for any new products or changes

Step 6: Cart & Checkout

Cart page (/cart/index.html)

List items, quantities, sizes, subtotal

Remove/update quantity → update local storage instantly

Checkout page (/checkout/index.html)

Delivery info form

Payment options: Bank transfer with proof upload (Cloudinary) or COD

Order summary → totals + delivery fee

Order confirmation page (/order/confirmation/index.html)

Shows order number, summary, payment instructions

Trigger Resend API email

Step 7: User Dashboard

Overview (/dashboard/index.html) → greeting, quick stats

Orders (/dashboard/orders/index.html) → live order status

Wishlist (/dashboard/wishlist/index.html) → live updates

Profile (/dashboard/profile/index.html) → editable, live updates

Reorders (/dashboard/reorders/index.html) → instant add-to-cart

Real-time:

Any updates from admin reflected instantly

Step 8: Admin Dashboard

Overview (/admin/index.html) → stats, recent orders

Orders (/admin/orders/index.html) → confirm/reject orders

Products (/admin/products/index.html) → add/edit/delete products

Payments (/admin/payments/index.html) → verify payment proofs

Maintenance toggle (/admin/maintenance-toggle/index.html)

Buttons: Live, Maintenance, Under Construction

Updates site-wide flag instantly

Real-time:

Product changes, order updates, and mode toggles reflected across all active users immediately

Step 9: Miscellaneous Pages

404 page (/misc/404.html) → fallback for invalid routes

Maintenance page (/misc/maintenance.html) → shown when maintenance toggle is on

Under-construction page (/misc/under-construction.html) → optional

Terms & Privacy pages (/policy/terms/index.html, /policy/privacy/index.html)

Newsletter confirmation page (/newsletter/confirmation/index.html)

Step 10: Real-Time Mechanism Across Website

In main.js, implement centralized real-time update checker:

Poll backend or use WebSocket

Update:

Products dynamically

Cart & wishlist

Orders & order status

Maintenance mode

Ensure no page refresh is required for any change

Include on all pages

Step 11: Testing

Responsiveness: mobile-first and desktop-first

Preloader performance

Real-time updates across all pages

Cart persistence, session persistence

Maintenance toggle works immediately for all users
